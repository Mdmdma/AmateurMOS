# Prospects of Multi-Object Spectroscopy in advanced Amateur Astronomy
This repository contains the supplementary materials for the semester project about MOS at a small telescope using a DMD chip as a variable slit mask. 

### The repository is available for download with
```
git clone git@github.com:Mdmdma/s4.git
```

### TLDR 
While it is possible to construct an optical setup achieving a spectral resolution of 200, which is sufficient to distinguish the line shape of the hydrogen lines at different temperatures, it is not possible to have a multitude of different objects that are bright enough in the field of view to get an advantage over a much more simple setup using a single slit.
