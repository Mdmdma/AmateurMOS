# Prospects of Multi-Object Spectroscopy in advanced Amateur Astronomy
This repository contains the supplementary materials for the semester project about MOS at a small telescope using a DMD chip as a variable slit mask. 

### TLDR 
While is possible to construct an optical setup achieving a spectral resolution of 200, mich is sufficent to distingues the line shape of the hydrogen lines at different temperatures, it is not possible to have a multitude of different objects that are bright enough in the field of view to get an advantage over a much more simple setup using a single slit.
